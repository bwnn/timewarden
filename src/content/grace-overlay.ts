/**
 * Grace Period Overlay — Content Script
 *
 * Injected into pages when a domain's time limit is reached.
 * Shows a 60-second countdown overlay before the page is blocked.
 *
 * This is a plain TypeScript file (no Svelte) that creates DOM elements
 * with inline styles, since content scripts run in the page context.
 *
 * Implementation will be completed in Phase 4.
