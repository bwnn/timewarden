# TimeWarden

Enforce daily time limits on websites. Take control of your browsing habits.

**This project was entirely generated and developed by AI** (Claude Code, using `claude-opus-4-5`). Every commit authored by AI is prefixed with `(Claude Code)` in the subject line and includes the footer `Generated by AI (Claude Code, claude-opus-4-5)`. The full development history -- from initial scaffold through all feature iterations -- was driven by AI with human direction. You can view the complete implementation plans and development journals in the `.ai/` directory (git-ignored, available only in local clones).

## What Is TimeWarden?

TimeWarden is a Manifest V3 browser extension (Firefox-first, Chrome-compatible) that works like iOS Screen Time for your browser. You configure per-domain daily time limits and the extension tracks your active browsing time, warns you as limits approach, and blocks access when time runs out.

**Core principles:**

- **No cheating** -- limits cannot be extended or bypassed once a tracking period has started
- **Exact domain matching** -- `youtube.com` does not match `music.youtube.com`
- **Multi-tab awareness** -- multiple tabs of the same domain do not drain time faster
- **Active engagement only** -- only focused tabs (and audible background media) count toward limits
- **Zero runtime dependencies** -- everything compiles away at build time

## Features

- **Per-domain daily time limits** with second-level precision
- **Day-of-week overrides** -- set different limits for weekdays vs. weekends (or any individual day)
- **Configurable reset times** -- choose when each domain's daily counter resets
- **Pause functionality** -- pause tracking with a configurable daily pause allowance
- **Grace period** -- a final warning window before hard-blocking a domain
- **Blocking page** -- a "Time's Up" page showing today's usage stats
- **Configurable notification rules** -- percentage-based or time-remaining triggers with per-domain overrides and custom messages
- **Toolbar badge** -- live countdown showing remaining time, pause state, or grace period
- **Settings lockdown** -- timing fields are locked once a tracking session has started for the current period
- **Destructive action confirmation** -- disabling a tracked domain requires typing the domain name to confirm
- **Revert changes** -- undo unsaved edits in settings with a single click
- **Dashboard** with analytics:
  - Today's overview with live progress bars
  - Historical stacked bar chart (pure SVG, no charting library)
  - Per-domain breakdown
  - Session analytics
  - Blocking statistics
  - Behavioral insights
- **Dark mode** -- light, dark, or system-preference with class-based toggling
- **Keyboard accessibility** -- focus-visible styles, ARIA roles, reduced-motion support

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) |
| UI Framework | Svelte 5 (runes) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Build Tool | Vite 6 |
| Extension API | MV3 (`browser.*` namespace) |
| Runtime Dependencies | None |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18 (developed on v24)
- **pnpm** (any recent version; developed on v10)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:bwnn/timewarden.git
cd timewarden

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Or watch for changes during development
pnpm run dev
```

The built extension is output to the `dist/` directory.

### Loading in Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**
3. Select any file inside the `dist/` directory (e.g. `dist/manifest.json`)

### Loading in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `dist/` directory

> **Note:** Chrome uses the `chrome.*` namespace. TimeWarden is written against the `browser.*` API. A polyfill like `webextension-polyfill` may be needed for full Chrome compatibility -- this has not been thoroughly tested.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run dev` | Build in watch mode for development |
| `pnpm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `pnpm run bundle:firefox` | Build and package into an unsigned `.zip` for Firefox |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `pnpm run svelte-check` | Run Svelte-specific validation |

## Architecture

The background service worker is split into six focused modules:

- **Tab Tracker** -- listens to tab/window events and exports shared state
- **Timer Engine** -- core state machine that tracks active time using timestamp-based tracking (survives MV3 service worker termination)
- **Storage Manager** -- all `browser.storage.local` CRUD with a serialized operation queue to prevent race conditions
- **Reset Manager** -- schedules per-domain daily resets using `browser.alarms`
- **Notification Manager** -- dispatches browser notifications based on configurable rules
- **Block Manager** -- handles grace periods, blocks domains, and intercepts navigation

UI pages communicate with the background via typed messages (`browser.runtime.sendMessage`). The popup polls for live status updates every second.

## Releases

Signed Firefox `.xpi` files are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bwnn/timewarden/releases) page. These can be installed directly in Firefox without any developer settings.

### Setup (one-time)

The release workflow signs the extension via the [AMO API](https://addons-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/api/signing.html), which requires API credentials:

1. Log in to [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/)
2. Go to **Tools > Manage API Keys** (or visit https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/api/key/)
3. Generate credentials -- you'll get a **JWT issuer** and **JWT secret**
4. Add them as repository secrets in GitHub (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**):
   - `AMO_JWT_ISSUER` -- the JWT issuer (API key)
   - `AMO_JWT_SECRET` -- the JWT secret

### Creating a release

Push a version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will build the extension, sign it via AMO as an unlisted extension, and attach the signed `.xpi` to a new release.

### Local bundling (unsigned)

For development and testing via `about:debugging`:

```bash
pnpm run bundle:firefox
# Output: web-ext-artifacts/timewarden-<version>.zip
```

## Known Limitations

- **No data migration** -- upgrading from an older storage format (minutes-based) requires clearing extension data
- **Chrome compatibility** -- uses `browser.*` namespace throughout; Chrome support is untested and may require a polyfill
- **Badge staleness** -- the toolbar badge can be up to 30 seconds stale between tab events
- **No keyboard shortcut** for pause/resume
- **Not published** -- the extension is not on any extension store; install via GitHub Releases or load from source
